These file have been produced by Helvin and me in late 1997.
They are a collection of thorougly worked examples for Sarsim2.
Unfortunately if recompilation is necessary make sure that the
directory \helvin is seen as h:\helvin as some images are
hardcoded to that drive. (i.e. copy helvin\*.* h:\helvin /s)

The main file is examples.tex.
All given script file examples are in directory \scr.

Enjoy.
