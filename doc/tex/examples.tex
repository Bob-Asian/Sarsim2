Various examples for different applications will be described in this
chapter. The script files for all examples are available in the \textbf{%
EXAMPLES} subdirectory.

\section{A typical C-band SAR Application}

For this SAR application a plane is flying in a straight line at some height
over an area, which has to be investigated. The radar is mounted on the
plane with a sideways looking beam. The simulation file can be found as ``%
\textbf{sar\_r.scr'}' in the ``\textbf{examples'}' directory.

This example will model the following scenario:

A plane is flying at $200$\thinspace m/s parallel to the $y$-axis at a
height of $2000$ meters and $10$\thinspace km horizontal distance from the
area of interest as shown in Figure~\ref{cbandplane}.

A sidelooking radar is mounted on the plane, the depression angle of the
beam is $11.3$ degrees. There have been $24$ point targets placed in an
``R'' shape, extending over $200$\thinspace x\thinspace $400$\thinspace m as
shown in Figure~\ref{r_setup}.

First the PLANE platform is created. This is done by creating a new platform
with the name ``PLANE'' and defining a trajectory for it. The $x$-coordinate
decreases linearly by $200$\thinspace m/s, the $y$-coordinate stays constant
at $-10000$\thinspace m and the $z$-coordinate stays constant at $2000$%
\thinspace m. Therefore we define the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Position $x=100$\thinspace m at time = $0$\thinspace s

\item  Position $x=-100$\thinspace m at time = $1$\thinspace s

\item  Position $y=-10000\,$m at time = $0$\thinspace s (one point suffices)

\item  Position $z=2000$\thinspace m at time = $0$\thinspace s (one point
suffices)
\end{itemize}

The plane will move $200$ meters in $1$ second, being closest to the earth
origin at $0.5$ seconds.

The next step is to create the radar on the PLANE platform, the given
parameters need to be entered in the dialogs.

The last step would be to create the point target setup as shown in Figure~%
\ref{r_setup}. For this setup a simulation has been stored already and can
be recalled by selecting \textbf{Simulation} / \textbf{Previous}. The window
shown in Figure~\ref{cbandsim} will appear.

Because the return signals of the point targets interfere with each other,
the original R-shape cannot be seen. However after saving this simulation
window and performing range and azimuth compression on it (in this specific
example the Chirp Scaling Algorithm has been applied), the image can be
restored as shown in Figure~\ref{sar_r}. Some artifacts appear on the upper
and lower border due to the fact that the azimuth range should have covered
more time.
