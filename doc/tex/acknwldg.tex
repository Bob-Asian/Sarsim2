My sincerest thanks go to my supervisor, Prof.~M.R.~Inggs, for his guidance,
advice and financial support, and ultimately for his encouragement to write
up my simulator manual into this dissertation.

I would also like to give special thanks to Richard Lord, Jasper Horrell and
Andrew Wilkinson for all their help, advice and discussions that enabled me
to write, debug and enhance the radar simulator.
