\section{Introduction}

The discrete analysis of radar signals, which are nothing else than
electromagnetic waves sent in a specific pattern, demands very powerful
computers. To undertake the task of writing a simulator is always a
compromise between accuracy and execution time. Many simulators have been
written to model the return of complex objects like aircraft or ships by
approximating them by a large number of surfaces. Although these simulations
(taking multiple reflections into account) give fairly reasonable
approximations for simple bodies, calculation times are usually measured in
hours.

A short description of the methods used in this case will be given:

The simulator used here models the reflective surface by means of very small
perfect `mirrors' called point targets. In theory, everything could be
modelled by an extremely large number of these point targets and the
reflected signal would just be a linear combination of these. However for
most simulation purposes a small number of point targets will be used to get
a clear picture of what the effects of changing certain conditions entail.

A radar is considered to be the transmitter and receiver of electromagnetic
pulses. Usually short bursts of energy are transmitted in regular intervals
at a certain carrier frequency. Sometimes the pulse is not modulated
(monochrome pulse), however more often it is. A very common linear frequency
modulation is called `chirp'. The purpose of modulation is to increase the
pulse length (less peak power required) without sacrificing resolution.
After reception the signals are mixed to baseband, in other words the
carrier frequency component is removed. For the purpose of this simulator,
the output will always be at baseband, due to the simple reason that
sampling at typical carrier frequencies would require an enormous number of
samples. (In practice the signal would be mixed to some intermediate
frequency). The simulator therefore can only do simulations which require
baseband signals.

As the reflected pulse will be a replica of the transmitted pulse (although
scaled in amplitude and shifted in phase), the simulator does a rather
simple task. It calculates the distance and the relative radial velocity of
all given point targets and constructs a sampled return array by adding
`pulses' at calculated positions within the array. Power losses introduced
by range and antenna gains are taken into account. Effectively the simulator
takes the burden of calculating the geometry setup at any given time. For
very simple simulations, this might be trivial, however for non-linear
moving targets or special antenna gain patterns for example, a computer
simulation is the only practical option.

The following pages will describe simple scenarios which will be simulated.
The results will be verified by applicable formulas.

When the simulation is run, the raw return will display the actual waveform
pulse as shown in Figure \ref{raw.gif}. To see the individual pulses, edit
the range and azimuth values in the window box. In this example, the slant
range is from 0 to 2000 m and the azimuth range is from 0 to 1.5 ms.

\begin{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Save file in ASCII format (for this example, the LSB was 1.67572$%
\cdot 10^{-6}$\thinspace mV).

\item  Open file in Excel. The `Text Import Wizard' window will appear.

\item  Select option `delimited' in the dialog box.

The spreadsheet will give a series of I and Q values. The number of values
will depend on the sampling frequency and the slant range used. For this
example, the sampling frequency was 20 times the Nyquist rate (0.2 MHz) and
the slant range was from 0 to 2000\thinspace m. The number of values
obtained for one single pulse was 53. The magnitude, phase and slant range
can be calculated from these values as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Magnitude}=\sqrt{\text{I}^{2}+\text{Q}^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Phase}=\left[ \limfunc{atan}\left( \frac{\text{Q}}{\text{I}}\right) -%
\frac{\text{180}}{\pi }\right] \pm n\pi \text{ where n is an integer}

\section{\protect\smallskip A stationary point target}

The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
\item  the phase shift of the reflected pulse due to range delay,

\item  power loss due to distance,

\item  and pulse compression by using matched filters.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Setup}

\smallskip This very simple example consists of a radar located at the
origin and a stationary point target on the $x$-axis at a distance of 1
kilometre..

\smallskip The radar parameters are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \smallskip Radar Position: origin of the `Earth' coordinate system

\item  \smallskip Pulse Type: monochrome

\item  \smallskip Pulsewidth: $T_{p}=5000$ ns

\item  \smallskip Pulse Repetition Frequency: 1000 Hz

\item  \smallskip Carrier Frequency: 1 GHz

\item  \smallskip Output Power: 1 kW

\item  Target cross-section: 1 m$^{2}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\protect\smallskip \protect\smallskip Results}

A typical simulation window is shown in Figure \ref{2}. Slow time (azimuth)
is presented on the $y$-axis (increasing from bottom to top), while fast
time (shown as slant range) is displayed on the $x$-axis.

Several facts can be observed from Figure \ref{2}. The target is stationary,
positioned at 1 km as specified. The pulse extends over 750 m in range. The
actual pulse length is twice that ($c\cdot T_{P}=1500$ m), the discrepancy
is due to the fact that the range and not the range delay is shown on the $x$%
-axis. In other words the time scale has been divided by a factor of two, as
the pulse has to travel back and forth. The pulse repetition interval (PRI)
is 1 ms.

After saving the data the phase and magnitude of the pulse can be
determined. Usually data is sampled with 8 bit or 12 bit accuracy. For this
example 8 bits will be used. The least significant bit value is chosen such
that the signal makes optimum use of the dynamic range without saturation
occurring. (In reality there will always be some saturation occurring due to
noise.)

For the given data the following values were obtained:

Least significant bit value = $1.6757\cdot 10^{-6}$ mV

$I=-24=(-24-127)\cdot 1.6757\cdot 10^{-6}$ mV = -253 $\ \mu $V (in-phase
component)

$Q=-121=(-121-127)\cdot 1.6757\cdot 10^{-6}$ mV = -415.6 $\mu $V (quadrature
component)

If the data is saved in binary format an offset of $\left( 2^{n-1}-1\right) $
is added, where $n$ specifies the number of bits used.

\subsection{Analysis}

\subsubsection{Sampling spacing}

In this specific simulation the data has been sampled at 20 times the
Nyquist rate, therefore $f_{s}=20\cdot 2\cdot \frac{1}{T_{P}}=8$ MHz.

For the given range window of 2 km shown in Figure \ref{2}, 53 samples were
taken. Each sample corresponds to $\frac{c}{2f_{s}}$ meters in range, where $%
c=299792500$ $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$.

\subsubsection{\protect\smallskip Power loss}

\smallskip Although the return pulse is of the same shape as the radiated
one, the magnitude is significantly less than the radiated pulse. The
received power is given by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\text{P}_{received}=\frac{\text{P}_{transmitted}\cdot G^{2}\cdot \lambda
^{2}\cdot \sigma }{(4\cdot \pi )^{3}\cdot R^{4}}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{itemize}
\item  $\sigma =$ target cross-section

\item  $\lambda =$ wavelength of pulse

\item  $R=$ distance to target

\item  $G=$ Antenna gain
\end{itemize}

For the given scenario the received power would be:

\begin{eqnarray}
\text{P}_{received} &=&\frac{\text{P}_{transmitted}\cdot G^{2}\cdot \lambda
^{2}\cdot \sigma }{(4\cdot \pi )^{3}\cdot R^{4}} \\
&=&\frac{1000\cdot 1\cdot 0.2998^{2}\cdot 1}{(4\cdot \pi )^{3}\cdot 1000^{4}}
\\
&=&45.293269\cdot 10^{-15}\text{ W}
\end{eqnarray}

which gives a corresponding amplitude (assuming the ubiquitous 1 $\Omega $
resistor) of:

\begin{equation}
\text{Magnitude}=\sqrt{\text{P}_{received}}=2.1282\cdot 10^{-4}\text{ mV}
\end{equation}

The simulated value gives a magnitude of $\sqrt{I^{2}+Q^{2}}=2.128\cdot
10^{-4}$ mV, which agrees with the above result.

\subsubsection{Phase shift}

The phase of the return pulse is determined by the wavelength and the
distance to the radar and is given by:

\begin{equation}
\text{Phase}=2\cdot \pi \cdot \left( -2\cdot d\cdot \frac{f}{c}\right) 
\end{equation}

where $c$ is the velocity of light and\ $d$ is the radar-target distance. As
the phase wraps around every 2$\pi $ radians, only the remainder can be
determined. For a point target at a distance of 1000 m:

\begin{eqnarray}
\text{Phase} &=&\func{mod}\left[ 2\cdot \pi \cdot \left( -2\cdot d\cdot 
\frac{f}{c}\right) ,2\cdot \pi \right]  \\
&=&\func{mod}\left[ 2\cdot \pi \cdot \left( -2\cdot 1000\cdot \frac{10^{9}}{%
299792500}\right) ,2\cdot \pi \right]  \\
&=&-1.7653 \\
&=&101.15\deg 
\end{eqnarray}

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ The simulation values give the same value: Phase $=-\frac{%
\pi }{2}-\arctan (\frac{-24}{-121})=-101.22\deg $. The slight discrepancy is
due to the 8 bit quantisation of the samples.

\subsubsection{Range Compression}

In pulse compression, the return pulse from the raw return is
compressed.\smallskip  This is achieved by using a matched filter. The
concept of range compression will be explained in more detail in the
following section.

The choice of a radar waveform will affect radar performance in terms of
range, Doppler, and angle measurements, as well as the system's detection
performance. For example, a short monochromatic pulse of timelength $t_{p}$
will allow a resolution of

\begin{equation}
\text{R}_{s}=\frac{c\cdot t_{p}}{2}
\end{equation}
\smallskip 

Therefore, targets that are closer in distance than R$_{s}$ cannot be easily
``resolved'' or separated, because the returns will overlap. The important
parameter for range resolution is bandwidth; thus, a monochrome pulse has an
effective bandwidth B$_{p}=\frac{1}{t_{p}}$. The effective bandwidth for a
monochrome pulse waveform is the bandwidth of the pulse spectrum. By making
a pulse shorter, or the effective bandwidth larger, range resolution is
improved. However, the amount of energy contained in the pulse diminishes as
the pulse shortens.

Improved detection is achieved by proper filtering or processing of the
received signal. The use of a matched filter optimises performance in the
presence of white, Gaussian noise. The return pulse is convolved with a
conjugate replica of itself. Since the pulse is rectangular in shape, a
convolution with itself will give a triangular pulse.

As can be seen from Figure \ref{3}, the resultant pulse is triangular in
shape. Since range-compression is computationally intensive, the sampling
rate can be set. Using low values for the sampling rate (less than the
Nyquist frequency) should be avoided due to aliasing. In this example, the
sampling rate used is a hundred (100) times the Nyquist frequency. It is to
be noted that neither the magnitude nor the phase changes when the return
pulse is range compressed.\smallskip \FRAME{fhFU}{2.1447in}{3.103in}{0pt}{%

\section{\protect\smallskip \protect\smallskip A moving point target}

The previous simulation demonstrated fixed point targets. For this
simulation the target will move relative to the radar. The purpose is to
demonstrate:

\begin{itemize}
\item  moving point targets

\item  chirp modulation

\item  matched filters

\item  range resolution

\item  Doppler frequency shift

\item  and the concept of moving platforms.
\end{itemize}

A platform is a convenient way of grouping targets, which are not moving
relative to each other, together. Their position and velocity can then be
set by just defining the trajectory of that specific platform.

\subsection{Setup}

\smallskip \smallskip The radar parameters are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Radar position: origin of the `Earth' coordinate system

\item  \smallskip Pulse Type: chirp

\item  Bandwidth: 0.1 GHz

\item  \smallskip Pulsewidth, $T_{p}$: 2500 ns

\item  Pulse Repetition Frequency: 1 kHz

\item  Carrier Frequency: 0.5 GHz

\item  Output power: 1 kW

\item  Target Cross-section: 1 m$^{2}$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\smallskip There are two targets that are 8 meters apart. They have been
grouped on a platform and the parameters for the platform are:

\begin{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  $x$ = 300 m and moving at a speed of 50 ms$^{-1}$ in the $x$-direction

\item  $y$ = 0

\item  $z$ = 0.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The geometrical setup is given in Figure \ref{4}.

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Raw Return}

\smallskip The pulse type used in this example is a chirp pulse. For chirp
waveforms, the frequency f$_{0}$ is not kept constant throughout the pulse,
but is linearly modulated from f$_{0}$ to $\left( \text{f}_{0}+\Delta \text{f%
}\right) $. $\Delta $f can be positive (up chirp) or negative (down chirp).
The result is a waveform which has a bandwidth that is independent of the
pulse length T$_{p}$. Thus, a pulse with large T$_{p}$ and large $B$ can be
constructed. The reason for using a chirp waveform, is to have a high energy
pulse which increases the range resolution capability of the radar. The
transmit waveform is generated with a frequency versus time domain waveform
as shown in Figure \ref{5}.

shown here for clarity). Due to the fact that there are two targets that are
close together, it is very difficult to separate the two targets from each
other. The received pulse consists of the return pulse from the two targets
interfering with each other.

\subsubsection{Range Compression}

In order to be able to distinguish between the two targets, range
compression is used. This is shown in Figure \ref{7}. From the figure, it
can be seen that the first target is at 300 m and the second one is at 308 m.

The theoretical resolution of the radar is determined by the using the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
\Delta R_{s}=\frac{c}{2\cdot B}
\end{equation}

where $B$ = bandwidth of the chirp pulse.

For the given bandwidth of 100 MHz, the resolution will be 1.5
meters.\smallskip

\subsubsection{Phase Shift}

\smallskip The first return of the first 9 pulses (the first pulse is sent
at time $t=0$ seconds) were sampled (after range compression), and the
corresponding phase values are shown in Figure \ref{targ2}. As the platform
is moving into positive $x$-direction, this will introduce a phase shift of
the return array for every pulse. The PRF = 1 kHz, therefore the target will
move 0.05 m/pulse. This corresponds to a phase shift of $2\cdot \pi \left( 
\frac{-2\cdot d}{\lambda }\right) =-1.0472$ radians, as verified in Figure 
\ref{targ2}. Point targets 1 and 2 are positioned at 300 m and 308 m
respectively at time $t=0$ seconds.

\section{Search Radar}

This example consists of a rotating antenna beam with a certain antenna gain
pattern an a single point target. A measure of the ability of an antenna to
concentrate energy in a particular direction is called the gain. Two
different, but related, definitions of antenna gain are the directive gain
and the power gain. The directive gain is descriptive of the antenna pattern.

The directive gain of a transmitting antenna is defined as the
ratio\smallskip 
\begin{equation}
G_{D}=\frac{\text{maximum radiation intensity}}{\text{average radiation
intensity}}
\end{equation}

\smallskip The radiation intensity is the power per unit solid angle in the
direction ($\eta ,\epsilon $) and is denoted by P($\eta ,\epsilon $). The
two-angle coordinates commonly used with ground-based antennas are azimuth
angle $\eta $ and elevation angle $\epsilon $.

A simple approximation to typical antenna gain patterns is the $\frac{\sin
(x)}{x}$ shape. This can be analytically calculated by considering the
current distributions across a circular aperture. The power radiation
pattern is \ a $\left( \frac{\sin (x)}{x}\right) ^{2}$ pattern. Figure~\ref
{gain} shows an example for a beamwidth of 10 degrees.

The half-power points would be at an offset of 5 degrees off the beam
centre. The amplitude gain is calculated by:

\begin{equation}
\text{Gain}=\frac{\sin (x)}{x},\text{ }x=0.88\cdot \pi \cdot \frac{\text{sin}%
(\theta )}{\text{Beamwidth}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Setup}

\smallskip This example consists of a search radar and a stationary point
target.\smallskip  The simulation parameters for the radar are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Monochrome pulse modulation, pulsewidth 5000 ns

\item  \smallskip Pulse repetition frequency: 400 Hz

\item  \smallskip Carrier frequency: 1 GHz

\item  \smallskip Output power: 1 kW

\item  $\sin (x)/x$ transmitter antenna gain, elevation beamwidth 30
degrees,\ azimuth beamwidth 1 degrees

\item  \smallskip Rotation rate 24 deg/s, beam elevation angle 30 degrees

\item  Target offset : $x$ = 1000 m, \smallskip $y$ = 1000 m, $z$ = 816 m
(distance = 1632.74~m)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\protect\smallskip Results}

The transmitter antenna gain pattern is a simple $\frac{\sin (x)}{x}$, the
power radiation pattern of the return pulse is a $\left( \frac{\sin (x)}{x}%
\right) ^{2}$. As can be seen from Figure \ref{8}, the return pulse has a
mainlobe and sidelobes of decreasing magnitude.

\subsubsection{Power Loss}

\smallskip The transmitted power is 1 kW and the received power at the beam
centre is calculated as follows:\smallskip 
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{P}_{received} &=&\frac{\text{P}_{transmitted}\cdot G^{2}\cdot \lambda
^{2}\cdot \sigma }{(4\cdot \pi )^{3}\cdot R^{4}} \\
&=&\frac{1000\cdot 1\cdot 0.2998^{2}\cdot 1}{(4\cdot \pi )^{3}\cdot
(1632.745)^{4}} \\
&=&6.37324\cdot 10^{-15}\text{ W}
\end{eqnarray}

\smallskip 
\begin{equation}
\text{Magnitude}=\sqrt{\text{P}_{received}}=7.9833\cdot 10^{-5}\text{ mV}
\end{equation}

\smallskip

The value obtained from the simulation is $7.97376\cdot 10^{-5}$ mV.

\subsubsection{\protect\smallskip Phase Calculation}

\smallskip \smallskip The $(x,y,z)$ coordinates for the target are (1000,
1000, 816).

\smallskip The distance of the target from the radar is $d=1632.744928$ m,
\smallskip $f=1$ GHz and \smallskip $c=299792500$ ms$^{-1}$.\smallskip 
\begin{eqnarray}
Phase &=&\func{mod}\left( 2\cdot \pi \cdot \left( -2\cdot d\cdot \frac{f}{c}%
\right) ,2\cdot \pi \right)  \\
&\approx &-\pi 
\end{eqnarray}

\smallskip

The phase is $-180$ degrees and from the simulation values, it can be seen
that the Q values are all zero and the I values are negative.

\subsection{\protect\smallskip \protect\smallskip Range Compression}

\smallskip The range compression result is shown in Figure \ref{9}. This was
obtained by convolving the raw return pulse with a conjugate replica of
itself.

\subsubsection{Resolution}

The theoretical resolution of the radar is

\begin{equation}
\Delta R_{s}=\frac{c}{2\cdot B}=\frac{299792500\cdot T_{p}}{2}=749.5
\end{equation}

The difference between the mainlobe and the first sidelobe levels is 13.5
dB. With filtering, the sidelobes can be reduced at the expense of
resolution.
